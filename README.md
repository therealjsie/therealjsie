### Hey there 👋

Thanks for checking out my github profile! I mostly use this place for tinkering with new tools, languages and ideas. If time allows I also contribute to open source projects. If you want to collaborate on something or just generally want to get in touch visit [jsie.de](https://jsie.de) and let me know.
